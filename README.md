  # HR Analytics and Attrition Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing HR data to understand attrition patterns, salary bands, promotions, and building predictive models to identify employees at risk of leaving. The project also includes model explainability using SHAP and visualization through Power BI.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on HR dataset.
- Analyze attrition by:
  - Department
  - Salary Bands
  - Promotions
- Build classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
- Apply **SHAP values** for model explainability.
- Create interactive dashboards in **Power BI**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SHAP  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data analysis and model building  

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Certain departments showed higher attrition rates.
- Low salary bands correlated with higher attrition.
- Lack of promotions significantly influenced attrition.
- Decision Tree provided interpretable rules for prediction.
- SHAP analysis highlighted key drivers such as `MonthlyIncome`, `YearsAtCompany`, and `JobRole`.

## 📑 Report

A detailed 2-page report is available in the `HR_Attrition_Analytics_Report.pdf/` file.  
It summarizes **EDA findings, model results, and SHAP explainability**.

---

## 📈 Dashboards

Interactive dashboards were created in **Power BI** to visualize:
- Attrition by Department  
- Salary Band distribution  
- Promotion and Attrition trends  

---

## ✨ Future Enhancements

- Add **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** models  
- Deploy model with a simple **Flask/Django** app  
- Automate dashboard refresh with **live HR data**  

---

## ✅ Final Conclusion

- This Power BI dashboard helps identify patterns among data professionals, such as which roles pay more, how happy employees are, and what skills they prefer. These insights can be used by:
- Recruiters for better targeting of candidates
- Educators to focus on high-demand skills like Python
- Professionals to benchmark their own roles and expectations
