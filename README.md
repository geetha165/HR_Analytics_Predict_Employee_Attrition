  # HR Analytics and Attrition Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing HR data to understand attrition patterns, salary bands, promotions, and building predictive models to identify employees at risk of leaving. The project also includes model explainability using SHAP and visualization through Power BI.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on HR dataset.
- Analyze attrition by:
  - Department
  - Salary Bands
  - Promotions
- Build classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
- Apply **SHAP values** for model explainability.
- Create interactive dashboards in **Power BI**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SHAP  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data analysis and model building

## 📊 Key Insights

- Certain departments showed higher attrition rates.
- Low salary bands correlated with higher attrition.
- Lack of promotions significantly influenced attrition.
- Decision Tree provided interpretable rules for prediction.
- SHAP analysis highlighted key drivers such as `MonthlyIncome`, `YearsAtCompany`, and `JobRole`.
